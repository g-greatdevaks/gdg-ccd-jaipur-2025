## üìÅ mcp-demo

The `mcp-demo` directory contains a hands-on demo project for building and connecting **MCP Servers** and **MCP Clients** using [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/), supporting both local and remote (cloud) deployments.

This project features:
- **Math operations** and **number-in-words explanations** powered by Gemini LLM (leveraging Sampling handler pattern).
- A **Streamlit Web Application** for interactive exploration.
- A **CLI-based MCP Client** for command-line testing.
- A **serverless barcode generator tool** hosted on Google Cloud Run as a remote MCP Server.

The demo showcases how to compose and orchestrate tools across local and remote MCP servers, enabling hybrid LLM agent workflows.

For complete instructions and setup, see: [`mcp-demo/README.md`](./mcp-demo/README.md).
